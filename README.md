# SimpleShell

A shell program that runs in the terminal and executes simple commands. It also can print out the history of the commands the user entered. Even if the user exits the shell, the history file is saved, and reopened for reading once the user runs SimpleShell again. Once the user exits by pressing Ctrl + c, the history file is supposed to be saved in the user's home directory.
